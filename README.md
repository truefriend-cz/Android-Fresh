## About app: init.d scripts support

How to run and execute Init.d scripts on Android devices without root access. Init.d is a very important file of Android operating system which executes and activates different scripts found on the phone. It is very useful because you can simply create a script you want and the Init.d file will activate it on the next boot.

But the problem is that unrooted stock phones do not support Init.d scripts folder. To be correct, the problem is with the kernel. Some kernels do not support Init.d scripts folder so you cannot add different useful scripts and let the Init.d file execute them.
